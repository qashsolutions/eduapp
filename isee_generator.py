Children played beneath its protective canopy every summer afternoon. The tree witnessed countless historical events over three centuries. Local historians documented its significance to the community. Birds nested in its hollow trunk each spring. The town council declared it a protected landmark last year. Residents gathered around it for annual festivals and celebrations. Strong winds occasionally broke its smaller branches. The groundskeeper carefully tended to its health. Lightning struck it once but failed to destroy its spirit. Artists frequently painted its impressive silhouette against sunset skies. The tree's roots extended deep beneath the cobblestone streets.

Writers often create fragments accidentally when they punctuate dependent clauses as sentences. Although everyone had studied diligently for the exam. Another example of an incomplete thought. The teacher explained that every sentence needs both a subject and a predicate. Walking along the beach at sunset. This phrase describes an action but lacks a subject. Students practiced combining fragments with independent clauses to create complete sentences. After the long winter finally ended. This temporal phrase needs a main clause. The editing process involves searching for these incomplete constructions. Which was exactly what they had hoped to find. Relative clauses also create fragments when isolated.

The sun set behind the mountains. Others enjoy compound sentences for their rhythm and flow. The musician practiced daily, yet she still felt nervous before performances. Simple sentences can be powerful and direct. The storm approached rapidly. Compound sentences allow writers to show relationships between ideas.

    Swimming competitively requires tremendous dedication and physical stamina. Training six days a week exhausts even the most committed athletes. Perfecting each stroke takes years of patient practice. Watching Olympic swimmers inspires young athletes to pursue their dreams. Breaking personal records motivates them through difficult workouts. Maintaining proper nutrition supports their demanding training schedule. Competing against talented opponents sharpens their skills considerably. Visualizing success helps athletes overcome pre-race anxiety. Listening to their coach's advice improves their technique steadily. Stretching before practice prevents painful injuries. Building endurance requires gradually increasing workout intensity. Supporting teammates creates a positive training environment. Analyzing race videos reveals areas needing improvement. Setting realistic goals keeps athletes focused and motivated. Balancing academics with training challenges student athletes daily. Traveling to competitions exposes them to different pool conditions. Winning medals rewards years of sacrifice and hard work. Learning from defeats builds character and resilience. Celebrating achievements with family makes victories more meaningful.

PASSAGE TO ANALYZE:
{passage}

GRAMMAR FOCUS: {grammar_concept}
CHAPTER CONTEXT: {chapter_title}

CRITICAL ANSWER CHOICE REQUIREMENTS:
- Generate exactly 5 answer choices (A, B, C, D, E) for each question
- TWO choices must be very similar - one correct, one close distractor
- Provide comprehensive explanations for why EACH wrong answer is incorrect
- Make all distractors plausible but clearly wrong upon analysis

QUESTION REQUIREMENTS:
Generate exactly 5 questions in this specific order:

1. MAIN IDEA: What is the primary purpose or central theme of this passage?
2. SUPPORTING DETAILS: A specific factual question about details mentioned in the passage
3. INFERENCE: What can be reasonably concluded or implied from the passage?
4. VOCABULARY IN CONTEXT: Meaning of a specific word as used in the passage
5. GRAMMAR FOCUS: Explicitly test the grammar concept "{grammar_concept}"

ANSWER CHOICE STRATEGY EXAMPLE:
If testing subject-verb agreement:
- Correct: "The subject and verb must agree in number"
- Close distractor: "The subject and verb must agree in person" (very similar but wrong)
- Other distractors: plausible but clearly different concepts
